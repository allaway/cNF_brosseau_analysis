GO_HIPPO_SIGNALING	> The series of molecular signals mediated by the serine/threonine kinase Hippo or one of its orthologs. In Drosophila, Hippo in complex with the scaffold protein Salvador (Sav), phosphorylates and activates Warts (Wts), which in turn phosphorylates and inactivates the Yorkie (Yki) transcriptional activator. The core fly components hippo, sav, wts and mats are conserved in mammals as STK4/3 (MST1/2), SAV1/WW45, LATS1/2 and MOB1.

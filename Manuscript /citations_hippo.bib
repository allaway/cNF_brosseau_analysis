abstract = {KEGG (http://www.kegg.jp/ or http://www.genome.jp/kegg/) is an encyclopedia of genes and genomes. Assigning functional meanings to genes and genomes both at the molecular and higher levels is the primary objective of the KEGG database project. Molecular-level functions are stored in the KO (KEGG Orthology) database, where each KO is defined as a functional ortholog of genes and proteins. Higher-level functions are represented by networks of molecular interactions, reactions and relations in the forms of KEGG pathway maps, BRITE hierarchies and KEGG modules. In the past the KO database was developed for the purpose of defining nodes of molecular networks, but now the content has been expanded and the quality improved irrespective of whether or not the KOs appear in the three molecular network databases. The newly introduced addendum category of the GENES database is a collection of individual proteins whose functions are experimentally characterized and from which an increasing number of KOs are defined. Furthermore, the DISEASE and DRUG databases have been improved by systematic analysis of drug labels for better integration of diseases and drugs with the KEGG molecular networks. KEGG is moving towards becoming a comprehensive knowledge base for both functional interpretation and practical application of genomic information.},

abstract = {Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a genetic disorder with a range of clinical manifestations such as widespread growth of benign tumours called neurofibromas, pain, learning disorders, bone deformities, vascular abnormalities and even malignant tumours. With the establishment of the Children's Tumour Foundation biobank, neurofibroma samples can now be collected directly from patients to be analysed by the larger scientific community. This work describes a pilot study to characterize one class of neurofibroma, cutaneous neurofibromas, by molecularly profiling of {\~{}}40 cutaneous neurofibromas collected from 11 individual patients. Data collected from each tumour includes (1) SNP Arrays, (2) Whole genome sequencing (WGS) and (3) RNA-Sequencing. These data are now freely available for further analysis at http://www.synapse.org/cutaneousNF.},
